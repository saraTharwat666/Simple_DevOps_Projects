# Dummy Systemd Service

## 🎯 Goal
Learn the basics of **systemd** by creating a simple background service that logs messages continuously.

## 📝 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:
- Create a long-running bash script (`dummy.sh`) that writes logs every 10 seconds.
- Define a **systemd service** (`dummy.service`) to manage the script.
- Start, stop, enable, disable, and monitor the service.
- Read logs generated by the service with `journalctl`.

## 🔧 Features
- Runs in the background indefinitely.
- Automatically starts on boot.
- Restarts automatically if it fails.
- Logs messages to track activity.
- Full control via `systemctl`.


## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding **systemd** and service management.
- Automating background tasks with bash scripts.
- Monitoring service status and logs.
- Gaining basic **DevOps** operational skills..
